Creating your first book
==========================

Now that you have Guide-API in your project, you can begin creating your own guide book. 

There are many ways you can handle the organization of your book, however I suggest a package for everything related to your guide(s) with a separate class for each Guide you add. Depending on how in-depth you go, the amount of organization you need gets... a bit *insane*.

You can either choose to follow the [basic](/basic/) guide or the [advanced](/advanced/) guide.
